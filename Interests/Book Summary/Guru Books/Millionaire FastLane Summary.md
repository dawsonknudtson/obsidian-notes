Traditional Way of Getting Rich is a scam

In what world does it make sense to 

1. Finish School - Todo More School
	1. I agree only if what you are doing isn't interesting to you
2. Get a Job
3. Work 40-50 Years
4. Retire at 65
5. Die by 70

Not only that notation but also just the way to 'get rich', Investing in Index Funds / ETF's for 40 years. Problem with this is it does not plan for uncertainty. Which I personally agree with, losing a job, economic crisis (Bubble). This way is no longer guaranteed, that 6-12% no longer a viable way to retire. 

From what Im seeing investing is a create way to multiply wealth but a bad way to make it, example I am 21, I had 1000 invested in SPY - Instead of investing in that, if I invested that into building a high income skill. It would have greater returns than any stock or crypto investment. I personally feel it is a waste to invest into anything if you have no skills. 

Hormozi talks about this, invest in the S&ME 500 not the S&P 500, this is sort of where my mindset is shifting as well. I was invested in crypto and was going to hold, a crisis in my life happened and realized very quickly that this 'Investment' was not as secure and good as I thought it was. Instead if I had the skills to make more money, I would have been better off. 

**New Perspective on Education**

Learning can be done so much faster solo than it can by an sort of institution. I still think college is needed but for maybe 85% of people it is a waste. Plus just the whole idea of having to go into debt and stuff does not sit right with me. Just because of the interest and college no longer is a golden ticket into a career / job. Education is really important, however college is not the most viable path anymore. I do think that my associates degree helped me a lot with my current skillset though. Debt also steals freedom. 

Don't fall into guru trap's. The dudes making money online that can solve all your problems. Don't fall for it, often these people do not make money with what they are preaching. 

**Don't Be a Consumer** 

Most people consume media and stuff all day long, never produce anything. You want to be the producer. That's why deleting social media on your phone is great, it forces you to not be a consumer, or at least it is harder. 

Same thing with a job, people just buy things. Wastefully, it is a trap designed by people smarter than you to keep you trapped. 

Produce With leverage, capital, labor, code and media.
