Most of this information is just study guide taken from cracking the coding interview book

| Data Structures            | Algorithms    | Concept's              |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Linked Lists               | BFS           | BIt Manipulation       |
| Trees, Tries, Graphs       | DFS           | Memory (Stack vs Heap) |
| Stacks & Queues            | Binary Search | Recursion              |
| Heaps                      | Merge Sort    | Dynamic Programming    |

**Main Languages 2025**

Enterprise : C# (.NET) , Java (Spring), MVC, Microservices, SQL, Sometimes a JS framework like angular or react 

Trading Firm's : C++, Python (ML)

Startups : JS (Node, React / Next,) --> Newer Technologies 

Smaller Companies Typically look for experience working with technologies, while mid - large company are asking the DSA questions and stuff. 

For Studying DSA Study in this order 

1. Array & String Manipulation
2. LinkedLists
3. Stacks & Queues 
4. Tree's and Graphs
5. Bit Manipulation (Not as prevalent today)
6. Math & Logic (BrainTeasers & Word Problems)
7. OOP & OOP Design
8. Recursion & DP
9. System Design & Scale
10. Sorting & Searching (Algorithms)
11. Testing
12. C & C++ (Defense Companies & Hardware)
	1. Mainly C for hardware, but sometimes C++
	2. Understanding Virtual Functions
	3. Constructors & Destructors 
	4. Virtual Destructor's
	5. Overloading
	6. Pointer's and References 
	7. Template
	8. Java (Enterprise) (OOP)
	9. Databases
		1. SQL
		2. Query's 
		3. 7 Step's of a Query
		4. Tables & PK - FK
		5. SP, Triggers, Index, Functions
		6. Where - Order by Clause
		7. Joins
13. Threads & Locks (Not as useful)

Advanced Topic's

1. Topological Sort
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm
3. Rabin-Karp Substring Search
4. AVL Tree's 
5. Red-Black Tree's
6. MapReduce
