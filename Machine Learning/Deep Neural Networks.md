NN organize neurons into layers, when collected together linear units have a common set of inputs and form a dense layer.

#Definition
 **Layers & Dense Layers** 

Layers : Collection of interconnected (un-isolated) nodes that process info and from their pass it to the next layer in the model

Typically their are three layers

1. input layer 
2. one or more hidden layers 
3. output layer 

example of a neural network w/ two hidden layers

Dense Layer : each ' neuron ' is connected to every neuron in the preceding layer, this allows complex linear operation to happen as well as followed by a activation function. 

(matrix multiplication and bias addition)
