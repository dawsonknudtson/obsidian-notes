Note's From CEO of Hyros Alex Becker - YT Videos on Business / Life  

You're brain is almost exactly like a computer, in the sense it derives pleasure as only binary operands, 1's and 0's. It(brain) does not care at all how it gets those 1's and 0's. 

You could spend all day eating cake and drinking and playing video games, you're brain will like it. Problem with that is, it is not earned dopamine. It is cheap or easy to get, no sense or work for it - meaning when you actually go to work on something meaning or important in you're life its really difficult. 

Like me for example, right now building interesting and possibly profitable projects to propel my career further and possibly get me into my dream career. 

Or find / figuring out what business I really want to pursue and do my best to go all in. Takes lots of thinking power and decision making. 

Short term pleasure would do nothing but distract me from figuring / thinking through these things. Getting these 1's constantly without any sort of work / time spend to get their makes the 1's that actually require work a lot harder. 

Example, when I was playing lots of video games around a year ago at 20, I could and would play effortlessly for 12-16 hours on end and I did that from 13-20. Until I fully quit midway through 20.

Surprisingly it was not hard at all for me quit, I just removed the distracting factor. Removed it from my environment, but from playing so long, trying to replace to habit was very difficult, reading a book even I love reading was very difficult, I could not focus or even think about what I was reading / going on. 

The overall highlight of this video is a concept I am interested in experimenting with, its a protocol involved in removing any source of dopamine that does not pertain to you're goals.

Thinking that this would really help and improve my life, by as quoted 'mounting the manticore' or removing any sorts of dopamine thats not you're goals. I already don't drink, gamble, smoke or any of that nonsense. 

But some things that are a real struggle has been

- Doom Scrolling Social Media
- Caffeine
- Analysis Paralysis

Scrolling is not the worst, but I sometimes get caught up in ig reels scrolling and before I know it, it's been 2 hours and suddenly I am no longer motivated to do nothing but keep scrolling. 

Caffeine is actually pretty bad, I get super anxious - but love the taste / edge it gives me. I consume way to much around 800-1000mg a day. I did a caffeine detox for 25 days, I felt great but caved.

Finally Analysis Paralysis or 'thinking' about things and not starting them, I first thought about starting my first business at 19 and never did anything at all until 21 and I stopped working on it because I gave up / didn't think I had enough information.
